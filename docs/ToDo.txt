High priority:
- Add ability to set bandmap start freq for different modes and bands (e.g. 3.700 instead of 3.600)
- freq columns in bandmap are not resized when we remove the frequency option
- Check the install directory and open warning pop-up informing the user what directories are allowed.
- send CW morse code character by character ( this will allow to edit the callsign while sending is in progress)
- Add all the SerialPort settings inside the Java app
- Update help (in Bulgarian?)
- add validation for the Log Window (now is possible to add invalid data); when correcting callsign in the log the call is written with small letters (similar for mode which causes exception)
- show qso rate
- show hints when hovering over controls
- all user settings and preferences should be saved - quitting the program (crash) should not delete the bandmap and all the other important settings
- serial comm - needs to work fast. There were some problems with responsivnes during the contest when using it togather with HDSDR
- the app should load the last used log. If there are no logs the app should ask you for name of the new log. Also add "New log" and "Open log" in the File menu
- when generating cabrilo check for obvious mistakes
- bandmap - add reset button
- input filter for the F messages
- bandmap - when hovering over the cell it should show the current freq
- delete callsign when moving away from freq and enter into bandmap
- remember the size of the columns in the tables


Recently Solved:
- implemented VoiceKeyer. If there is a "cq.wav" in the main dir of the program. The file will be played and PTT manipulated when F1 is pressed while on LSB or USB. 
- second part of sent serial number is not updated (e.g. when changing the RCV serial number from the table)
- last S&P qso per band and mode should be visible on the bandmap
- Bandmap start moved from 3.6MHz to 3.7MHz
- Mix mode (SSB and CW) is now supported. The 30min rule is now applied per callsign and mode (not like before only for callsign regardless of the mode).
- In settings the repeat period of the contest is now in Minutes and not in Seconds.
