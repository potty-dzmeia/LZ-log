- Option for continious CQ
- serial comm needs to work fast. There were some problems with responsivnes during the contest
- when generating cabrilo check for obvious mistakes
- on the bandmap blue entries were actually dupes
- mouse press on bandmap should always work - get rid of the table borders if possible
- Try to catch all keyboard presses (f4 should not close HDSDR)
- the keys for adding spot and deleting a field should not be so close (i.e. f11 and f12)
- quitting the program (crash) should not delete the bandmap and all the other important settings
- all user settings and preferences should be saved
- hide the freq columns
- add reset button to the bandmap
- comm port should be "undefined" (or somthing similar) if the one selected is not active.
- if the freq columns are removed from the bandmap try horizontal organization 
- when hovering over the cell it should show the current freq




After contest:
- band map should be updated depending on the current freq and mode
- there should be an option for entering worked frequency for people that do not use CAT
- For some reason F10 is activating the Menu
- add validation, so that we can't manually enter wrong data in the Log table(e.g. Snt 00300f)
- when correcting callsign in the log the call is written with small letters
- adjust row sizes depending on the font
- delete callsign when moving away from freq and enter into bandmap
- new settings options should not break window organization
- Baud rate settings to be done from the App.
- fix icom functionality
- enter frequency in callsign
- note za wsqka vruzka 
- opciq vsichki nuli da sa T
- remember the size of the columns in the tables
- alt+k = 
- first part of sent serial number is not updated (e.g. when changing the serial number from the table)


Solved:
- For Elekraft when sending CW put space between F-keys (e.g. f5 i f2)
- ;' - da rabotqt
- mark CQ frequency on bandmap
- show my cq freq on the bandmap
- new bandmap spot should not be prevented if there is a same spot close to this frequency (was 500Hz now is 100Hz)
