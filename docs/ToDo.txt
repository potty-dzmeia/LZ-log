- Option for continious CQ

 	





After contest:
- band map should be updated depending on the current freq and mode
- there should be an option for entering worked frequency for people that do not use CAT
- For some reason F10 is activating the Menu
- add validation, so that we can't manually enter wrong data in the Log table(e.g. Snt 00300f)
- when correcting callsign in the log the call is written with small letters
- adjust row sizes depending on the font
- mark CQ frequency on bandmap
- new settings options should not break window organization
- Baud rate settings to be done from the App.
- fix icom functionality
- enter frequency in callsign
- delete callsign when moving away from freq and enter into bandmap
- note za wsqka vruzka 
- vsichki nuli da sa T
- remember the size of the columns in the tables
- alt+k = 
- first part of sent serial number is not updated (e.g. when changing the serial number from the table)


Solved:
- For Elekraft when sending CW put space between F-keys (e.g. f5 i f2)
- ;' - da rabotqt
- show my cq freq on the bandmap
