High priority:
- support Icom CAT
- create help
- there should be an option for entering worked frequency for people that do not use CAT
- band map should be updated depending on the current freq and mode
- show qso rate
- show hints when hovering over controls
- all user settings and preferences should be saved - quitting the program (crash) should not delete the bandmap and all the other important settings
- serial comm - needs to work fast. There were some problems with responsivnes during the contest when using it togather with HDSDR
- the app should load the last used log. If there are no logs the app should ask you for name of the new log. Also add "New log" and "Open log" in the File menu
- when generating cabrilo check for obvious mistakes
- Try to catch all keyboard presses (f4 should not close HDSDR)
- the keys for adding spot and deleting a field should not be so close (i.e. f11 and f12)
- bandmap - add reset button
- input filter for the F messages
- bandmap - when hovering over the cell it should show the current freq


Low priority:
- For some reason F10 is activating the Menu
- when correcting callsign in the log the call is written with small letters
- adjust row sizes depending on the font
- delete callsign when moving away from freq and enter into bandmap
- enter frequency in callsign
- note za wsqka vruzka 
- opciq vsichki nuli da sa T
- remember the size of the columns in the tables
- alt+k = 
- first part of sent serial number is not updated (e.g. when changing the serial number from the table)
- remember which windows are maximized/minimized


Solved:
- continious CQ interval should work 
- serial comm  - commport should be "undefined" (or somthing similar) if the one selected is not active.
- Baud rate settings to be done from the App.
- support for winkey
- Focus change should be reliable now (using requestrequestFocusInWindow())
- bandmap - hide the freq columns
- For Elekraft when sending CW put space between F-keys (e.g. f5 i f2)
- ;' - da rabotqt
- mark CQ frequency on bandmap
- show my cq freq on the bandmap
- new bandmap spot should not be prevented if there is a same spot close to this frequency (was 500Hz now is 100Hz)
- mouse press on bandmap should always work - get rid of the table borders if possible (events handled on mouse pressed)
- bandmap - blue S&P entries were actually dupes (bug)
- "do not show after" to be 4 hours
- new settings options should not break window organization
