High priority:
- freq columns in bandmap are not resized when we remove the frequency option
- ESM should be exactly like in N1mm
- Check the install directory and open warning pop-up informing the user what directories are allowed.
- send CW morse code character by character ( this will allow to edit the callsign while sending is in progress)
- Add all the SerialPort settings inside the Java app
- Add ability to set bandmap start freq for different modes and bands (e.g. 3.700 instead of 3.600)
- Remember the CQ frequency mode.
- Update help (in Bulgarian?)
- last S&P qso per band and mode should be visible on the bandmap
- add validation for the Log Window (now is possible to add invalid data); when correcting callsign in the log the call is written with small letters (similar for mode which causes exception)
- there should be an option for entering worked frequency for people that do not use CAT
- show qso rate
- show hints when hovering over controls
- all user settings and preferences should be saved - quitting the program (crash) should not delete the bandmap and all the other important settings
- serial comm - needs to work fast. There were some problems with responsivnes during the contest when using it togather with HDSDR
- the app should load the last used log. If there are no logs the app should ask you for name of the new log. Also add "New log" and "Open log" in the File menu
- when generating cabrilo check for obvious mistakes
- bandmap - add reset button
- input filter for the F messages
- bandmap - when hovering over the cell it should show the current freq


Low priority:
- Allow change of the CW speed in function messages
- delete callsign when moving away from freq and enter into bandmap
- enter frequency in callsign
- note za wsqka vruzka 
- remember the size of the columns in the tables
- alt+k = 
- first part of sent serial number is not updated (e.g. when changing the serial number from the table)
- the keys for adding spot and deleting a field should not be so close (i.e. f11 and f12)

Last Solved:
- Try to catch all keyboard presses (f4 should not close HDSDR)  -- Done by external native Win32 application
- Serial number like in N1mm
- If default prefix is used it should always stay in the entry window
- The default is now visible in the entry window
- send all zeros as T
- Adif export supported
